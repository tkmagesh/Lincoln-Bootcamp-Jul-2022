Angular Building Blocks
    Modules
        Logical grouping of components, directives, pipes and services.
        There has to be a minimum of one module in an application.
        Modules are the starting point of the application (bootstrap).

    Components
        Represents ONE UI aspect of the application
        Encapsulates Presentation (template) + UI Interaction + State
        Application is a composition of components

    Directives
        DOM Manipulation
        ex, change the style of an element
            show or hide an element

    Pipes
        Data transformation logic for PRESENTATION
        ex Date -> dd-mmm-yyyy OR dd/mmm/yyyy OR dd/mm/yyyy

    Services
        Represents any NON-UI responsibility of the application

Angular CLI
    Tool to perform all development activities for an angular application
    NPM package

    Install CLI
        npm install -g @angular/cli

    To use yarn as package manager
        ng config -g cli.packageManager yarn


Package.json
    Manifest file for any javascript project
    Contains meta-data information about the project
        name
        version
        author
        description
        keywords
        repository
        license
        scripts
        dependencies
            dependencies that are needed for the project to run
            These will be a part of the application build 

        devDependencies
            dependencies that are needed for perform development activities
                ex, development web server
                    test runner
                    unit testing framework
                    typescript compiler           
            will NOT be a part of the application build


Exercise
    Create a Greeter component with the following template and render it in the application
    <div>
        <h3>Greeter</h3>
        <hr>
        <label for="">User Name :</label>
        <button>Greet</button>
