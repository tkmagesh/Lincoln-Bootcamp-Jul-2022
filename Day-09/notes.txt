Angular Building Blocks
    Modules
        Logical grouping of components, directives, pipes and services.
        There has to be a minimum of one module in an application.
        Modules are the starting point of the application (bootstrap).

    Components
        Represents ONE UI aspect of the application
        Encapsulates Presentation (template) + UI Interaction + State
        Application is a composition of components

    Directives
        DOM Manipulation
        ex, change the style of an element
            show or hide an element

        Types:
            Attribute Directive
                Changes the attribute of an existing dom node
                Does not change the dom structure 
                Used with []
                ex: ngClass, ngStyle

            Structural Directive
                Changes the structure by adding or removing dom nodes
                Used with * prefix
                ex: ngIf, ngSwitch, ngFor

    Pipes
        Data transformation logic for PRESENTATION
        ex Date -> dd-mmm-yyyy OR dd/mmm/yyyy OR dd/mm/yyyy

    Services
        Represents any NON-UI responsibility of the application

Angular CLI
    Tool to perform all development activities for an angular application
    NPM package

    Install CLI
        npm install -g @angular/cli

    To use yarn as package manager
        ng config -g cli.packageManager yarn


Package.json
    Manifest file for any javascript project
    Contains meta-data information about the project
        name
        version
        author
        description
        keywords
        repository
        license
        scripts
        dependencies
            dependencies that are needed for the project to run
            These will be a part of the application build 

        devDependencies
            dependencies that are needed for perform development activities
                ex, development web server
                    test runner
                    unit testing framework
                    typescript compiler           
            will NOT be a part of the application build

            <option value="multiply">Multiply</option>
            <option value="divide">Divide</option>
        </select><input type="number" name="" id="">
        <button>Calculate</button>
        <div>[result]</div>
    </div>


Exercise:
    Create a 'Products' component with the following template.
    Use cases:

Exercises
    1. Currency Converter
        Conver the given value in USD to any of the list of currencies based on user choice

    2. Implement Pagination

    3. Create a SalaryCalculator component (done)

    Instantiation and Injection is taken care of by angular

    Steps:
